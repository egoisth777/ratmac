# ratmac

The one-minute front door. Locate anything from here; nothing here binds -
the law lives one link away.

ratmac (`rtm`) is a Rust engine that runs agent work as an explicit state
machine. A runbook (`.arca/ratmac.toml`, plain TOML) declares phases,
prompts, guards, and transitions; the Engine instantiates it into a Run and
is the only writer of run state. Progress is proven by machine-checked
guards over artifacts on disk - never by an agent's claim. Deterministic and
offline: no network, no installs, no hidden global state.

| Where we are heading; the lines no work may cross | [steering.md](steering.md) |
| How the system hangs together right now | [map.md](map.md) - stamped cache; orientation, never evidence |

## Where things live

All agent routing and documentation must use these paths.

| Path | What lives there |
| :--- | :--- |
| `.arca/steering.md` | Direction and guardrails: thesis, invariants, non-goals; first re-aligned on a pivot. |
| `.arca/schema.md` | The working rules - binding for every contributor. |
| `.arca/map.md` | Stamped architecture cache; orientation only, never evidence. |
| `.arca/current/` | The goal bundle now in force (`spec.md` > `design.md` > `test-list.md`, plus `ubi-lang.md`, `index.md`). Frozen per Run. |
| `.arca/issue/<issue-id>/` | One incoming issue, exactly five files (shape: schema.md, "The issue folder"). |
| `.arca/residual/` | Gap records, one per requirement - proven yet? |
| `.arca/ticket/` | Small self-contained work units, cut from gap records. |
| `.arca/state.toml` | Run state - written ONLY by `rtm`; everyone else reads. |
| `.arca/log.md` | Append-only history; every landing leaves a line. |
| `.arca/tpl/` | Blank forms; a form filled in at its proper path is the real thing. |
| `.arca/vis/` | Shared pictures and graphs. |
| `.arca-private/` | Hidden test code, out of git, listed by its owning ticket. |
| `test/` | The runnable suite plus `test/test-list.md`. |
| `src/` | The Engine. How it hangs together: [map.md](map.md). |

## Bootstrap

    pwsh -File tools/rtm.ps1   # resolve (or build) and pin-check the Engine
    rtm doctor                 # orient: engine identity, runbook, run state

Details, caller policy, and everything binding: [schema.md](schema.md).
